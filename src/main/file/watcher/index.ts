/**
 * DirectoryWatcher — generic FS-monitoring primitive.
 *
 * Phase status: Phase 1a exports the **factory signature + event union only**.
 * The concrete watcher (chokidar-backed, debounce + dedupe, DanglingCache
 * auto-wire) lands in Phase 1b.3.
 *
 * ## Positioning
 *
 * - **Not a lifecycle service.** Business modules (e.g. a future NoteService)
 *   instantiate their own watcher via `createDirectoryWatcher(path)` and
 *   dispose it themselves; the factory transparently forwards events into
 *   the file-module's `DanglingCache` so external-entry presence tracking
 *   stays coherent across all watchers.
 * - **Open to the entire main process.** Like `ops/*`, the watcher primitive
 *   has no entry-system awareness; it is a thin wrapper over `chokidar` with
 *   house conventions (ignore rules, debounce window, event normalization).
 *
 * See [file-manager-architecture.md §8](../../../../docs/references/file/file-manager-architecture.md)
 * and RFC §9.5 for the full design.

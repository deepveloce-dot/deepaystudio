/**
 * DanglingCache — external-entry presence tracker.
 *
 * Phase status: Phase 1a exports the **interface only**. The concrete
 * singleton (reverse-index Map<path, Set<entryId>>, cold-path `fs.stat`
 * fallback, watcher-event ingestion) lands in Phase 1b.3.
 *
 * Responsibilities (target):
 * - Maintain a best-effort "present / missing / unknown" state per external
 *   FileEntry, populated lazily from `fs.stat` and updated eagerly by
 *   DirectoryWatcher events.
 * - Serve File IPC `getDanglingState` / `batchGetDanglingStates` queries
 *   without blocking on FS IO in the hot path (cache hit returns synchronously).
 *   DataApi never reads this cache — DataApi is strict SQL-only.
 * - Emit subscription events so the UI can react to external file
 *   disappearance without polling.
 *
 * Internal entries are always `'present'` — the cache is external-only.
 *
 * See [file-manager-architecture.md §11](../../../docs/references/file/file-manager-architecture.md)
 * for the full design; see RFC §9.5 for Phase 1b.3 deliverables.

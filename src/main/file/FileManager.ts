/**
 * FileManager — contract surface for the planned sole public entry point for
 * all file operations.
 *
 * Phase status:
 * - **Current phase**: this file is contract-first. It exports the public
 *   types, method signatures, and architectural JSDoc that later phases must
 *   implement.
 * - **Planned Phase 1b+**: a concrete `FileManager extends BaseService`
 *   lifecycle service will live here, be registered in `serviceRegistry.ts`,
 *   and be resolved at runtime via `application.get('FileManager')`.
 *
 * Every FileEntry has an `origin`:
 * - `internal`: Cherry owns the content (stored at `{userData}/files/{id}.{ext}`)
 * - `external`: Cherry references a user-provided absolute path
 *
 * ## Facade pattern
 *
 * In the target implementation, FileManager is a **thin facade** — it exposes
 * the public IPC-backed API and delegates every method to pure-function
 * modules under `./internal/*`. The concrete class will only own:
 * - lifecycle (`onInit` / `onStop`; IPC handler registration via `BaseService`)
 * - `versionCache` (LRU backing `writeIfUnchanged` / `getVersion`)
 * - `FileHandle.kind` dispatch at the IPC boundary
 *
 * In the target implementation, external Main callers will go through the
 * lifecycle-managed singleton via `application.get('FileManager')`. This
 * module currently exposes the type surface only; `internal/*` remains a
 * private implementation area and is not re-exported via `src/main/file/index.ts`.
 *
 * See `docs/references/file/file-manager-architecture.md §1.6` for the full
 * implementation-layout decision.
 *
 * ## FileHandle dispatch at the IPC boundary
 *
 * FileManager's public API (below) is **entry-native** — every method takes a
 * `FileEntryId`. Main-side business services call it directly without having
 * to wrap ids in a handle.
 *
 * At the IPC boundary, the renderer speaks `FileHandle` (a tagged union whose
 * variants select the *reference form* — `FileEntryHandle` routes through the
 * entry system, `FilePathHandle` hits `ops/*` directly). Dispatching on
 * `handle.kind` is treated as the IPC adapter's legitimate responsibility
 * (translating request shape), not business orchestration. In the planned
 * lifecycle implementation, `FileManager.onInit()` will register handlers with
 * the private `dispatchHandle` helper:
 *
 * - `{ kind: 'entry', entryId }` → the corresponding FileManager public
 *   method (e.g. `this.read(entryId, opts)`)
 * - `{ kind: 'path', path }`     → the `*ByPath` variant exported from
 *   `internal/*` (e.g. `contentRead.readByPath(deps, path, opts)`)
 *
 * `*ByPath` variants are not exposed on the FileManager class — Main-side
 * callers have no use for them (they hold FileEntry, not arbitrary paths).
 *
 * New handle kinds (e.g. `virtual` for zip members) extend `dispatchHandle`
 * and each IPC handler within this file; the public API surface and
 * `internal/*` pure-function structure both stay stable.
 *
 * See `docs/references/file/file-manager-architecture.md §1.6.5` for the
 * full dispatch convention.
 *
 * ## External entries — best-effort reference semantics
 *
 * External entries represent "the caller expressed an intention to reference
 * this path at some point in time". Cherry does not track external renames/
 * moves; external filesystem changes surface naturally as "read returns new
 * content" or "entry becomes dangling".
 *
 * Which callers use internal vs external is a business-layer decision —
 * FileManager makes no assumption. For module boundaries and dangling-state
 * tracking, see:
 * - [file-manager-architecture.md](../../../docs/references/file/file-manager-architecture.md)
 * - [architecture.md](../../../docs/references/file/architecture.md)
 *
 * Cherry **allows** user-initiated modification of external files:
 * - `write` / `writeIfUnchanged` → atomic write to `externalPath`
 * - `rename` → `fs.rename` + update DB
 *
 * Cherry **never** modifies external files automatically. Specifically:
 * - No watcher-driven writebacks
 * - No background sync
 * - No tracking of external rename/move
 * - `permanentDelete` on an external file_entry removes only the DB row — this
 *   entry-level operation is deliberately decoupled from physical deletion.
 *   Path-level deletion remains available via `ops.remove(path)` (reached
 *   through a `FilePathHandle`), which is an explicit user-facing operation
 *   not tied to any entry id.
 *
 * **External entries cannot be trashed.** Their lifecycle is monotonic:
 * created by `ensureExternalEntry` (pure upsert keyed by path — see below),
 * updated in place via `write` / `rename`, and removed only by an explicit
 * (non-UI) `permanentDelete`. The `fe_external_no_trash` CHECK constraint
 * enforces this at the DB level; `trash` / `restore` on an external entry id
 * will throw.
 *
 * `ensureExternalEntry` is a pure upsert on the `externalPath` global unique
 * index: existing entry at the same path is reused; otherwise a new row is
 * inserted. No "restore trashed" branch — trashed external entries cannot
 * exist. External rows carry no stored `size` (always `null`); consumers
 * needing a live value call `getMetadata(id)`.
 *
 * Dangling state is tracked by the file_module's `DanglingCache` singleton,
 * not by FileManager itself. FileManager ops update the cache as a side effect
 * of successful/failed stats.

/**
 * Best-effort identity of a file's current on-disk state, captured from
 * `fs.stat`.
 *
 * ## Precision caveat
 *
 * `mtime` resolution is **filesystem-dependent**:
 * - APFS / ext4 / NTFS (local) — typically nanosecond / millisecond precision
 * - FAT32 / exFAT / SMB / NFS — **second-precision** (any sub-second change is
 *   invisible to `mtime` alone)
 *
 * Combined with a same-size edit, a second-precision `FileVersion` comparison
 * can **silently mis-identify two different files as equal**. `writeIfUnchanged`
 * would then run over "stale" data without tripping `StaleVersionError`.
 *
 * ## Fallback strategy (Phase 1b.2 implementation contract)
 *
 * When `writeIfUnchanged` suspects second-precision mtime ambiguity
 * (observed mtime has ms === 0 AND size matches expected), the implementation
 * MUST fall back to a xxhash-128 `contentHash` comparison before committing.
 * Hash computation is deliberately deferred to this corner case — for the
 * common case (sub-second mtime resolution or size difference) the
 * `(mtime, size)` pair is sufficient.
 *
 * `FileVersion` itself intentionally excludes content hash — embedding the
 * hash would force computing it on every read, which is wasteful. The hash
 * is only materialized inside the fallback path, not stored in the cache.

/**
 * Atomic write stream: buffered to a tmp file until `.end()` commits the write

 *
 * ## Lifecycle
 *
 * - `.write(chunk)` — buffers to the tmp file. Honors Node's standard
 *   back-pressure semantics (return value `false` = pause until `'drain'`).
 * - `.end(chunk?)` — finalises the tmp file, fsyncs, then `rename(tmp → target)`.
 *   On success emits `'finish'`; on failure emits `'error'` after attempting
 *   to unlink the tmp file. This is the **commit path** — no rename happens
 *   on any other terminal transition.
 * - `.destroy(err?)` — abnormal termination (Node stream convention). The
 *   implementation treats this the same as `.abort()` + error propagation:
 *   no rename, tmp file is unlinked best-effort.
 * - `.abort()` — explicit cancel. Unlinks the tmp file and resolves once
 *   cleanup completes. Idempotent. Preferred over `.destroy()` when the
 *   caller wants to discard the write deliberately (e.g. validation failed)
 *   — `.abort()` returns a promise that awaits the unlink, while `.destroy()`
 *   follows the fire-and-forget Node convention.
 *
 * The only way to commit is `.end()`. `.abort()`, `.destroy()`, GC-collection,
 * process exit — all result in **no** rename onto the target path.

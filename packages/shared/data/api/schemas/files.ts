/**
 * File API Schema definitions (read-only DataApi)
 *
 * DataApi is a **pure SQL read surface** for file data. Handlers:
 *
 * - MUST NOT read or `stat` the filesystem
 * - MUST NOT call main-side resolvers (`resolvePhysicalPath`, etc.)
 * - MUST NOT consult in-memory caches outside the DB (no `danglingCache.check`, no `versionCache`)
 * - MUST return a **fixed shape per endpoint** — no opt-in flags that toggle extra fields
 *
 * The only allowed "derivation" inside DataApi is **SQL aggregation** (JOIN / GROUP BY /
 * COUNT), because that stays in the DB layer. Anything that requires FS IO or main-side
 * computation lives in **File IPC** (see `packages/shared/file/types/ipc.ts`).
 *
 * Endpoints:
 * - `GET /files/entries`            — FileEntry list (fixed shape)
 * - `GET /files/entries/:id`        — Single entry lookup (fixed shape)
 * - `GET /files/entries/ref-counts` — Pure-SQL ref-count aggregation for a batch of ids
 * - `GET /files/entries/:id/refs`   — File references for a specific entry
 * - `GET /files/refs/by-source`     — File references by business source
 *
 * ## Where former opt-in derived fields live now
 *
 * The previous design exposed `includeRefCount` / `includeDangling` / `includePath` /
 * `includeUrl` as opt-in flags on the entries endpoints. They were removed to keep the
 * DataApi boundary strict — DataApi is now pure SQL, no hidden IO. The former fields
 * moved to dedicated channels:
 *
 * | Former opt-in       | Current home                                                           |
 * |---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 * | `includeRefCount`   | `GET /files/entries/ref-counts?entryIds=...` (still DataApi, dedicated)|
 * | `includeDangling`   | File IPC `getDanglingState` / `batchGetDanglingStates` (FS-backed)     |
 * | `includePath`       | File IPC `getPhysicalPath` / `batchGetPhysicalPaths` (main resolver)   |
 * | `includeUrl`        | Shared pure helper `toSafeFileUrl(path, ext)` in `@shared/file/urlUtil`, composed in-process from the `FilePath` returned by `getPhysicalPath` (no dedicated IPC) |
 *
 * Renderers compose data by fetching the entry list here, then calling the relevant
 * batch IPC methods with the retrieved ids. Wrap the two-step pattern in a dedicated
 * hook when a pattern recurs (e.g. `useEntriesWithPresence`).
 *
 * ## External entries — no size snapshot
 *
 * External rows carry `size: null` by design — external files may change outside
 * Cherry at any time, so no DB snapshot is kept. `name` / `ext` are pure
 * projections of `externalPath` (basename / extname) and therefore stable as
 * long as the entry itself exists. Consumers needing a live `size` / `mtime`
 * call File IPC `getMetadata(id)` which performs a single `fs.stat`.

   * Sorting caveat: `sortBy: 'size'` is only meaningful within an
   * `origin='internal'` filter. External rows have `size IS NULL` (no DB

   * a live size-sorted view of external entries must fetch unsorted and sort
   * in the renderer after calling `getMetadata`.

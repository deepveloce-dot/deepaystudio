/**
 * File entry entity types
 *
 * Zod schemas for runtime validation of FileEntry records.
 * FileEntry is a flat list of Cherry-managed files (no tree structure).
 *
 * Every entry has an `origin`:
 * - `internal`: Cherry owns the content, stored at `{userData}/files/{id}.{ext}`.
 *   `name` / `ext` / `size` are authoritative truth (kept in sync by atomic writes).
 * - `external`: Cherry only references a user-provided path (`externalPath`).
 *   `name` / `ext` are pure projections of `externalPath` (basename / extname) —
 *   stable as long as the reference itself is stable. `size` is **not stored**
 *   for external entries (`null`); consumers needing a live value call File IPC
 *   `getMetadata(id)` which runs `fs.stat` on demand.
 *
 * Timestamps are numbers (ms epoch) matching DB integer storage.
 * For file reference types, see `./ref/`.
 *
 * ## Invariants
 *
 * | Field         | origin='internal'      | origin='external'                              |
 * |---------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
 * | `name`        | SoT (user renamable)   | derived from `externalPath` basename (stable)  |
 * | `ext`         | SoT                    | derived from `externalPath` extname (stable)   |
 * | `size`        | SoT (bytes, ≥ 0)       | **always `null`** — live value via `getMetadata`|
 * | `externalPath`| null                   | non-null absolute path                         |
 * | `trashedAt`   | nullable               | **always null** (external cannot be trashed)   |
 *
 * ## Why `size` is null for external
 *
 * External files can change outside Cherry at any time (user edits, another app
 * overwrites, the file gets moved). Storing a snapshot here would create two
 * classes of bugs: (a) callers silently consuming stale values, (b) "refresh"
 * operations that merely move the staleness window. Making `size` unavailable
 * at the DB layer forces consumers to make the freshness tradeoff explicit —
 * either they don't need it, or they call `getMetadata` for a live `fs.stat`.
 * `name` / `ext` stay on the row because they are pure projections of
 * `externalPath` (which is the SoT) and therefore cannot drift while the entry
 * exists; the cost of recomputing `path.basename` on every row is not worth
 * the denormalization saving.
 *
 * ## Type safety: Zod brand on FileEntry
 *
 * `FileEntrySchema` is branded so arbitrary object literals cannot satisfy
 * the `FileEntry` type. Only values that have passed `FileEntrySchema.parse()`
 * (or `.safeParse()` with success) carry the brand. This forces entry
 * production through sanctioned paths (FileManager `createInternalEntry` /
 * `ensureExternalEntry` IPC, DataApi handler row→DTO conversion, FileMigrator
 * insert) which own the derivation of `name`/`ext`/`size`/etc.
 *
 * ## Lifecycle
 *
 * Internal entries:
 *
 * ```
 *                  ┌──────────┐
 *        ┌────────│  Active   │←───────┐
 *        │        └────┬─────┘        │
 *        │             │ trash()      │ restore()
 *        │             ▼              │
 *        │        ┌──────────┐        │
 *        │        │ Trashed  │────────┘
 *        │        └────┬─────┘
 *        │             │ permanentDelete()
 *        │             ▼
 *        │        ┌──────────┐
 *        └───────→│ Deleted  │
 *  permanentDelete└──────────┘
 * ```
 *
 * External entries are monotonic — no Trashed state:
 *
 * ```
 *   ensureExternalEntry   ┌──────────┐   permanentDelete   ┌──────────┐
 *   ────────────────────→│  Active   │───────────────────→│ Deleted  │
 *                         └──────────┘                     └──────────┘
 *                         (update in place via rename / write)
 * ```
 *
 * - Active:   `trashedAt = null` (the only legal state for external; enforced
 *             by both Zod `z.null()` on `ExternalEntrySchema.trashedAt` and the
 *             DB `fe_external_no_trash` CHECK)
 * - Trashed:  `trashedAt = <ms epoch>` (internal-only)
 * - permanentDelete on internal: unlink FS file + delete DB row
 * - permanentDelete on external: **DB row only** — the physical file is left
 *   untouched. Entry-level deletion is decoupled from physical deletion;
 *   callers wanting to delete the file on disk should invoke the path-level
 *   unmanaged `ops.remove(path)` separately.

// ─── Canonical External Path (TS phantom brand) ───

/**
 * A `string` already processed through `canonicalizeExternalPath`.
 *
 * This is a **TypeScript-only phantom brand** (zero runtime cost, zero wire
 * cost) that acts as a compile-time guard for every DB read/write surface on
 * `externalPath`: any query entry point that filters by `externalPath` MUST
 * narrow its input to this type, which forces callers through
 * `canonicalizeExternalPath()` instead of accepting a raw user path.
 *
 * ## Why a brand and not runtime validation
 *
 * The correctness invariant — "the string equals `canonicalizeExternalPath(x)`
 * for some `x`" — cannot be verified at runtime without re-running
 * canonicalization, which would defeat the purpose. The brand expresses
 * "this value was produced by the authorized factory" structurally, so the
 * type system (not runtime checks) enforces the contract.
 *
 * ## Authorized construction
 *
 * - **Production code**: only `canonicalizeExternalPath()` in
 *   `src/main/data/utils/pathResolver.ts` may produce values of this type.
 *   Other production code importing `CanonicalExternalPath` MUST receive it
 *   from that function (directly or transitively) — never via `as` cast.
 * - **Tests and fixtures**: may cast known-canonical string literals with
 *   `'/abs/path' as CanonicalExternalPath` for readability.
 * - **DB rows**: the `externalPath` column is typed as `string | null` in
 *   Drizzle (SQLite has no brand concept); upcasting into
 *   `CanonicalExternalPath` at the service boundary is acceptable because
 *   writes on that column already go through the canonicalization path.
